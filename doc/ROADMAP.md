# Roadmap

- [ ] perform player-stats data fetch in a separate thread to not block the TS3 ui
- [ ] show a `summary` and/or `average` line in the TS3 log-area when printing players stats for a channel
- [ ] make Battle-Tag detection in TS3 client-names more flexible (e.g. handle `name # 1234`, `name #1234`, `name / #1234`

# History

### 0.1a-preview
- show stats for a single player in the TS3 client-info area in channel list (triggered by selecting clients)
- show stats for a group of players in the TS3 log-area for all TS3 clients in a channel (triggered by context-menu action)
